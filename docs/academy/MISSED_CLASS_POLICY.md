# SwimBuddz Academy: Missed Class Policy

Welcome to the Academy! Consistently attending your scheduled sessions is the fastest way to build confidence and skill. Because our curriculum is progressive—each week builds directly on the last—missing a class can affect your momentum.

We understand that life happens. Here is how we handle absences to keep you safe and on track.

## 1. Safety First: The "Digital Catch-up"

If you miss a class for any reason (illness, work, travel), you must "catch up" mentally before getting back in the water.

- **Step 1:** Mark your absence in the SwimBuddz App.
- **Step 2:** Watch the **Video Lesson** for the week you missed. This will be automatically unlocked in your "My Progress" tab.
- **Step 3:** Arrive 1 hour early to your next class. Your coach will do a "dry-land" or shallow-water check to ensure you understand the key safety skills from the missed week.

## 2. Types of Absences

### 🤒 The Early Cancel (Planned or Sudden)

- **Protocol:** Please mark yourself absent in the app as soon as you know. This frees up your spot for potential make-up students.
- **Make-up:** You receive **2 Floating Credits** per 12-week term. These credits can be used to book a spot in our special **"Saturday Open Practice"** sessions. These are coached sessions designed specifically to help you practice skills you missed or struggled with.

### 🚑 The Long-Term Absence (Injury/Emergency)

- **Protocol:** If you must miss **3 or more consecutive weeks** (e.g., due to injury), please contact support immediately.
- **Re-entry:** For your safety, you cannot jump back into a later week (e.g., Week 8) after missing a month of training. We will pause your membership and help you restart at Week 1 in a future cohort at no extra cost.

### ⛈️ System Cancellations (Our Fault)

- **Protocol:** If _we_ cancel a class (e.g., pool maintenance, instructor illness), you are not penalized.
- **Resolution:** The term will either be extended by one week, or you will receive a pro-rated credit for your next renewal.

## 3. The "Two-Miss" Rule

If you miss **two consecutive classes** without a make-up session in between, we require a **Private Safety Check** (discounted rate) before you rejoin your group.

**Why?** Missing two weeks means missing significant safety milestones. This brief 1-on-1 session ensures you are safe to rejoin the group without anxiety or risk.
