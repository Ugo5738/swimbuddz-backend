## 1. Welcome to the Team

### 1.1 Who We Are

SwimBuddz is building Africa's leading swimming community. We believe everyone deserves to experience the joy and safety of swimming, regardless of age or background.

Our Academy is where transformation happens. As a coach, you're not just teaching swimming—you're building confidence, conquering fears, and changing lives.

### 1.2 Our Mission

**"Water is Home."**

We're creating a world where every African feels at home in the water. You're on the front line of that mission.

### 1.3 What Makes Us Different

- **Community-first**: We're not a corporate swim school. We're a family.
- **Safety-obsessed**: We never cut corners on safety.
- **Progress-focused**: We track real outcomes, not just attendance.
- **Coach-centered**: When coaches thrive, learners thrive.

### 1.4 The Three Layers

SwimBuddz operates across three layers:

| Layer | What It Is | Your Role |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Community** | Social swimming, open meets, casual engagement | May assist at events |
| **Club** | Regular training for committed swimmers | May coach sessions |
| **Academy** | Formal education, cohort-based programs | Your primary focus |

As an Academy coach, you deliver structured programs where learners progress through defined curriculum with clear milestones.

---

## 2. How SwimBuddz Works

### 2.1 You're a Partner, Not an Employee

You work with SwimBuddz as an **independent contractor**. This means:

**What it means for you:**
- You teach within our standards
- You're responsible for your own taxes
- No fixed salary—you earn based on what you deliver

**What stays the same:**
- You follow SwimBuddz curriculum and safety protocols
- You represent the SwimBuddz brand professionally
- You use our systems for attendance and progress tracking

### 2.2 How Programs Work

**Programs** are the courses we offer (e.g., "Adult Beginner Freestyle").

**Cohorts** are groups of learners going through a program together (e.g., "January 2026 Batch").

**Blocks** are 4-week periods. This is how we track progress and payment.

Example:
- Program: Adult Beginner Freestyle (12 weeks total)
- Your cohort: 8 learners
- Duration: 3 blocks of 4 weeks each
- You get paid 3 times—once per block

### 2.3 Learner Payment vs Your Payment

| What Learners See | What You See |
|-------------------|--------------|
| One price, paid upfront | Payment per 4-week block |
| "12-week program for ₦150,000" | 3 payments of your share |
| Clear commitment | Predictable income |

This works because:
- Learners commit fully (no drop-off excuses)
- You get paid reliably
- SwimBuddz handles all the payment admin

---

## 3. Your Role as a Coach

### 3.1 What You Do

As a SwimBuddz coach, you:

- **Deliver sessions** according to SwimBuddz curriculum
- **Track progress** using our milestone system
- **Provide feedback** to help learners improve
- **Maintain safety** at all times
- **Build community** among your cohort
- **Represent SwimBuddz** professionally

### 3.2 What You Don't Do

- Collect payments from learners (SwimBuddz handles this)
- Modify curriculum without approval
- Make commitments on behalf of SwimBuddz
- Share learner information with third parties
- Run private sessions using SwimBuddz branding

### 3.3 The SwimBuddz Way

**Be patient.** Many of our learners are adults facing deep-seated fears. Progress takes time.

**Be encouraging.** Celebrate effort, not just achievement. A fearful adult who puts their face in the water deserves applause.

**Be safe.** Never compromise on safety protocols. Ever.

**Be professional.** You represent SwimBuddz in every interaction.

**Be present.** Show up on time, prepared, and focused.

---

## 4. Getting Paid

### 4.1 Revenue Share Model

You earn a **percentage of the learner fees** for your cohorts. The percentage depends on:
- Your coach grade (Grade 1, 2, or 3)
- The program category (some categories pay more)
- Any special modifiers (location difficulty, etc.)

### 4.2 How It's Calculated

```
Your Payment = Total Revenue × Your Revenue Share %

Where:
Total Revenue = Number of Learners × Fee per Block
```

**Example:**
- You have 8 learners paying ₦50,000 per block
- Total revenue = ₦400,000
- Your share is 47%
- **You earn ₦188,000** for that 4-week block

### 4.3 Current Pay Bands

| Grade | Typical Range |
|-------|---------------|
| Grade 1 | 35-42% |
| Grade 2 | 43-52% |
| Grade 3 | 53-65% |

Some programs pay more (special populations, certifications) and some pay slightly less (institutional programs where SwimBuddz handles all the sales).

### 4.4 When You Get Paid

- Payments are calculated per **4-week block**
- Processed within **7 business days** after each block ends
- Paid via **bank transfer** to your registered account

### 4.5 What Affects Your Pay

**Positive modifiers (+1-3% each):**
- Larger cohort sizes
- Difficult locations (far, limited facilities)
- Difficult time slots (early morning, late evening)
- Mentoring a junior coach
- Piloting a new program

**Your grade is the biggest factor.** Focus on progressing through the grades for meaningful pay increases.

## 5. Coach Grades

### 5.1 The Three Grades

| Grade | Title | What It Means |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Grade 1** | Foundational | Entry-level programs, learning the ropes |
| **Grade 2** | Technical | Independent operation, more complex programs |
| **Grade 3** | Advanced/Specialist | High-complexity programs, leadership eligible |

### 5.2 What Each Grade Can Do

| Capability | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Basic cohorts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Complex cohorts | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Specialist programs | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Work independently | After training | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mentor others | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Input on curriculum | ❌ | Consultation | Active |
| Leadership track | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### 5.3 Grade by Category

Your grade is **category-specific**. You might be:
- Grade 2 in Learn-to-Swim
- Grade 1 in Competitive Training (because you're new to it)
- Not graded in Special Populations (no credentials yet)

This means you can teach at different levels depending on the program type.

### 5.4 How Programs Are Graded

Every cohort gets a "complexity score" that determines the required coach grade:

| Cohort Score | Required Grade |
|--------------|----------------|
| 7-14 | Grade 1 coach (or higher) |
| 15-24 | Grade 2 coach (or higher) |
| 25-35 | Grade 3 coach only |

Higher grades can always teach lower-grade cohorts, but not vice versa.

## 6. Growing Your Career

### 6.1 From Grade 1 to Grade 2

**Requirements:**
- 6+ months active coaching
- 100+ coaching hours logged
- 3+ cohorts completed successfully
- Learner feedback rating ≥ 4.0/5.0
- No safety incidents
- Required certifications obtained
- Pass practical assessment

**Timeline:** Typically 6-12 months

### 6.2 From Grade 2 to Grade 3

**Requirements:**
- 12+ months at Grade 2
- 300+ coaching hours
- 8+ cohorts completed
- Feedback rating ≥ 4.3/5.0
- Clean safety record
- Demonstrated specialization
- Mentored at least 1 junior coach
- Pass panel assessment
- Endorsement from 2 senior coaches

**Timeline:** Typically 18-36 months

### 6.3 The Progression Process

1. **Express interest** to your Academy Manager
2. **Review eligibility** against requirements
3. **Complete credentials** (if any missing)
4. **Schedule assessment**
5. **Pass assessment**
6. **Grade updated** in system
7. **New assignments** at higher grade
8. **Pay increases** automatically

### 6.4 Cross-Category Growth

Want to teach in a new category? You start at the appropriate grade for that category, even if you're Grade 3 elsewhere.

Example: You're Grade 2 in Learn-to-Swim. You want to coach Competitive programs. You'd need to:
1. Verify your competitive swimming background
2. Get required certifications
3. Start at Grade 1 in Competitive
4. Progress through that track

**Fast-track available** if you have external credentials and verified experience.

### 6.5 Maintaining Your Grade

Grades aren't permanent. You must maintain:
- Active coaching (2+ cohorts per year)
- Current certifications (first aid, CPR, etc.)
- Minimum feedback ratings
- 8 hours professional development per year
- Code of conduct compliance

Fall below standards? You'll get a review and improvement plan. Persistent issues can result in downgrade.

## 8. Safety First

### 8.1 The Golden Rules

1. **Never coach alone** without lifeguard support (unless you're a certified lifeguard yourself)
2. **Never exceed learner capability** — if in doubt, don't
3. **Never compromise on ratios** — max learners per coach are set for a reason
4. **Always check conditions** — water, weather, facility
5. **Always have emergency plan** — know where exits, first aid, and phone are

### 8.2 Before Every Session

**Pool check:**
- [ ] Water clarity (can you see the bottom?)
- [ ] Water temperature (comfortable range)
- [ ] Lane availability (as booked)
- [ ] Deck clear of hazards
- [ ] Lifeguard present (if required)

**Equipment check:**
- [ ] Floats and noodles in good condition
- [ ] Kickboards available
- [ ] First aid kit accessible
- [ ] Rescue equipment in place

### 8.3 During Sessions

**Constant vigilance:**
- Count heads regularly
- Watch for signs of distress
- Stay close to struggling learners
- Never turn your back on the water

**Signs of trouble:**
- Quiet panic (gasping without calling out)
- Grabbing for sides or others
- Eyes wide, head back
- Unable to respond to instructions

### 8.4 If Something Goes Wrong

**Minor incident (scrape, bump, panic):**
1. Calm the learner
2. Assess injury
3. Provide first aid if needed
4. Log in system within 24 hours

**Serious incident (injury, near-drowning):**
1. **Stop the session immediately**
2. Call for help / lifeguard
3. Administer first aid / CPR if trained
4. Call emergency services if needed
5. **Report to SwimBuddz immediately** (same day)
6. Write detailed incident report

### 8.5 Certification Requirements

| Grade | First Aid | CPR | Lifeguard |
|-------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| Grade 1 | Recommended | Recommended | Not required |
| Grade 2 | Required | Required | Recommended |
| Grade 3 | Required | Required (+ AED) | Required |

Keep certifications current. Expired = can't coach.

## 9. Working with Learners

### 9.1 The SwimBuddz Learner

Our learners are diverse:
- **Adults learning to swim** for the first time (often with deep fears)
- **Children** of all ages and abilities
- **Seniors** seeking gentle, joint-friendly exercise
- **Athletes** wanting to improve technique
- **Special needs** learners requiring extra care

What they all share: **they trusted us with something vulnerable**.

### 9.2 Handling Fear

Many adults carry childhood trauma around water. Here's how to help:

**Do:**
- Validate their fear ("It's completely normal to feel nervous")
- Give scientific explanations ("Your body naturally floats because...")
- Progress in tiny steps
- Celebrate every small win
- Be patient—progress may be slow

**Don't:**
- Say "just relax" (dismissive)
- Push them past their comfort zone too fast
- Compare them to others
- Show frustration
- Make them feel embarrassed

### 9.3 Giving Feedback

**The SwimBuddz way:**

1. **Start positive** — find something they did well
2. **Be specific** — "Your arm entry was much smoother" not "good job"
3. **One thing at a time** — don't overwhelm
4. **Show, don't just tell** — demonstrate or use video
5. **End encouraging** — "You're making real progress"

### 9.4 Handling Difficult Situations

**Learner not progressing:**
- Assess if there's a specific block
- Try different approaches
- Consider 1:1 attention within session
- Discuss with learner privately
- Escalate to Academy Manager if needed

**Learner complaints:**
- Listen without defensiveness
- Thank them for feedback
- Explain if there's a misunderstanding
- Report to SwimBuddz if serious
- Follow up on resolution

**Learner misconduct:**
- Address immediately but calmly
- Remove them from water if safety risk
- Report to SwimBuddz
- Don't argue publicly

### 9.5 Professional Boundaries

**Always:**
- Maintain appropriate physical distance
- Keep communication through official channels
- Treat all learners equally
- Respect privacy

**Never:**
- Exchange personal phone numbers (use app)
- Meet learners outside sessions privately
- Accept gifts beyond small tokens
- Discuss other learners' progress

## 11. Frequently Asked Questions

### About Getting Started

**Q: How long does onboarding take?**
A: Typically 2-3 weeks including shadowing and assessment.

**Q: What if I don't have all the certifications?**
A: You can start the process. Some certifications can be completed while onboarding.

**Q: Can I choose which cohorts to teach?**
A: We consider your preferences, but assignments are based on availability, qualifications, and program needs.

### About Pay

**Q: Why revenue share instead of fixed pay?**
A: It aligns incentives—when you have engaged learners, everyone wins. It also gives you potential to earn more as you progress.

**Q: What if learners drop out?**
A: Pay is based on active learners at block start. Mid-block drops don't affect your pay for that block.

**Q: How do I know my revenue share percentage?**
A: It's in your agreement and visible in your coach profile. Contact Academy Manager if unclear.

### About Grades and Growth

**Q: Can I request a grade assessment?**
A: Yes, once you believe you meet the requirements. Talk to your Academy Manager.

**Q: What if I disagree with my assessment result?**
A: You can request feedback and a development plan. Re-assessment is possible after addressing gaps.

**Q: Is there a cap on how high I can go?**
A: Grade 3 is the highest coaching grade. Beyond that, leadership roles (Head Coach, Academy Director) become available.

### About Operations

**Q: What if I can't make a session?**
A: Notify SwimBuddz 48+ hours in advance. We'll arrange cover. Repeated absences affect your standing.

**Q: Can I bring my own equipment?**
A: Standard equipment is provided. Personal equipment needs approval.

**Q: Can I give private lessons to SwimBuddz learners?**
A: No. This violates your agreement. If a learner wants extra help, direct them to official options.

### About Safety

**Q: What if I witness something unsafe at the pool (not my session)?**
A: Report it to pool management and SwimBuddz. We take all safety matters seriously.

**Q: What if a parent wants to watch but the pool doesn't allow it?**
A: Follow pool rules. Explain to parents. Offer progress updates via system instead.

### B.4 Data Models

**CoachProfile Extension:**
```typescript
interface CoachProfile {
  id: string;
  memberId: string;

  // Grades by category
  grades: {
    learn_to_swim?: CoachGrade;
    special_populations?: CoachGrade;
    institutional?: CoachGrade;
    competitive_elite?: CoachGrade;
    certifications?: CoachGrade;
    specialized_disciplines?: CoachGrade;
    adjacent_services?: CoachGrade;
  };

  // Progression stats
  totalCoachingHours: number;
  cohortsCompleted: number;
  averageFeedbackRating: number;

  // Credentials
  certifications: {
    type: string;
    issueDate: Date;
    expiryDate: Date;
    isValid: boolean;
  }[];

  // Status
  isActive: boolean;
  lastActiveDate: Date;
}
```

**SessionAttendance:**
```typescript
interface SessionAttendance {
  sessionId: string;
  cohortId: string;
  date: Date;
  coachId: string;

  attendees: {
    enrollmentId: string;
    status: 'present' | 'absent' | 'late' | 'excused';
  }[];

  notes: string;
  loggedAt: Date;
}
```

### B.5 Notifications

**Coach should receive notifications for:**
- New cohort assignment
- Milestone claim submitted by learner
- Learner message received
- Session reminder (24 hours before)
- Block payment processed
- Grade progression eligibility
- Certification expiry warning (30 days before)

### B.6 Mobile Considerations

Coach dashboard should be mobile-first:
- Attendance marking works offline (sync when connected)
- Quick session start from home screen
- Push notifications for urgent items
- Swipe gestures for common actions
- Camera integration for milestone evidence review
